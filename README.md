## Unit 12 - Web Scraping and Document Databases

For this exercise I chose to do a real-world web scrape for common carpentry tools. The purpose of this was to build a preliminary database of items that a family member lost in an instance of garage theft. The dataset was meant to be used in a court proceeding and to account for losses incurred. The Flask portion of this assignment was intentionally left out. 

### Objectives

* Create and connect to local MongoDB databases.
* Create, read, update, and delete MongoDB documents using the Mongo Shell.
